The First Darlek Empire has written: "The simplest statement we know of is the statement of Davross himself, namely, that the members of the empire should destroy 'all life forms,' which is understood to mean universal destruction. No one is justified in making any other statement than this" (First Darlek Empire letter, Mar. 12, 3035; see also DE 11:4).
