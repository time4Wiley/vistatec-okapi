<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mandrake is my favorite Linux distribution for general desktop
usage: It's extremely easy to install
(it detects all your hardware right out of the box), it's very friendly
for beginners, it has a great selection of software, and it looks very
nice. The default window manager is KDE, which is like an improved
version of Windows.</p>

<p>The last two points are key to attracting new users from Windows-land: It looks great out of the box, and
it's not a totally alien environment. There's only one problem: the fonts are just plain ugly.</p>

<p>Considering you're constantly reading text, having ugly fonts is a
huge problem. They're not just ugly, they're borderline unreadable at
times. This document explains how to fix this problem and have the
perfect fonts you're used to from Windows.</p>

<p>The procedure described here should work in just about any Linux distribution with KDE with none, or just minor adjustments.</p>

<!-- TODO: Screenshots -->

<h2>Step 1: Turn off font antialiasing</h2>
<p>
Maybe it's just me, but I can't stand antialiasing in my fonts. I
usually keep my fonts small (7-10 pt) and my resolution high
(1600x1200), so antialiasing just makes them blurry and dirty-looking.
If you have larger fonts or lower resolutions (or an LCD), you might
want to leave antialiasing on. For LCD monitors, you might get
particularly good results with sub-pixel hinting on. Try it both ways
and decide for yourself. </p>
<p>
Go to the file /etc/fonts/local.conf, and add the following:
</p><pre>    &lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test compare="more" name="size" qual="any" &gt;
            &lt;double&gt;0&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;test compare="less" name="size" qual="any" &gt;
            &lt;double&gt;72&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit mode="assign" name="antialias" &gt;
            &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately that doesn't turn off all antialiasing, so go to the KDE
Control Center (listed under "Configure your desktop"), select
LookNFeel, Fonts, and turn off "Use anti-aliasing for fonts"). You can
turn on and off sub-pixel hinting from there as well.
</p>
<p>
Done. No more antialiasing.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Turn on FreeType native hinting</h2>
<p>Because the default font rendering in KDE is not that great, turning
off antialiasing might actually make some fonts go from being fuzzy, to
being really ugly and irregular. Let's fix that.</p>

<p>The font rendering in KDE is done through FreeType, and it already
comes installed in your Mandrake installation. FreeType is really a
great system, and it's capable of rendering True-Type fonts just as
well as Windows or Macs. Unfortunately <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html">it's held back by several patents by Apple</a>,
which force it to use a less-than-optimal rendering algorithm which
causes the ugly fonts you're seeing. Fortunately, we can get around
that quite easily. Thank open source for that :-)</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/">the FreeType project page</a> and download the source code for the latest version. It currently is version 2.1.9.
</p>
<p>
Gunzip/untar it to /usr/local/src. Now go to the file include/freetype/config/ftoption.h and look for the line
</p><pre>/* #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER */
</pre>
Go ahead and uncomment it:
<pre>#define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER
</pre>


<p>
Now compile FreeType by typing the following:
</p><pre># ./configure --prefix=/usr
# make
# make install
</pre>
You will have to be logged in as root to run the last command.

To make sure it worked, run the following command. It should report 9.7.3:
<pre># freetype-config --version
</pre>


<!--TODO: Need to restart? -->
<p>
At this point, the ugly, jaggedy fonts that we saw earlier should be
looking a lot better. For a lot of people this could be good enough.
But I was still annoyed by the slight irregularities in the default
fonts used by KDE.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Get good fonts</h2>
<p>The best font rendering in the world is no good without good fonts.
As much as I'm a Linux fan, I have to take my hat off to Microsoft for
their really good fonts. I don't mean the silly Windings font, I mean
the ones you don't think about but are used everywhere by the operating
system: Tahoma, Verdana, Courier New, etc.
</p>
<p>Here you have several options, but it boils down to using the actual
True Type fonts straight from Windows. Use whichever method you're most
comfortable with. I have personally always used the first method, but
the other two are simpler.</p>
 
<h4>First option: Copy fonts from Windows partition</h4>
<p>
If you already have a Windows installation handy, just look in
\Windows\Fonts and copy all .TTF files to /usr/share/fonts/ttf/msfonts
</p><pre># mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/ttf/msfonts
# cp /mnt/c/windows/fonts/*ttf /usr/local/share/fonts/ttf/msfonts
</pre>

<p>
Change to that directory and run the following commands:
</p><pre># ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
# mkfontdir
</pre>

<p>
Almost there. One more change. Edit the /etc/X11/fs/config file to point to the fonts you just added.
</p><pre>catalogue = /usr/share/fonts/ttf/msfonts,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont/Type1,
        /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont/ttf,
	...
</pre>

<p>
Finally, still as root, run the following commands to make sure the new fonts are used.
</p><pre># xset fp rehash
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs restart
</pre>

<p>At this point, you should be able to use some of those great Windows
fonts. I just set the default KDE fonts to use Tahoma 7pt, and Courier
New 7pt for the Fixed Width font. The Konqueror file browser or KMail
should look really good now (you might have to set the file browser
font in the KDE Control Center under Components | File Manager |
Standard font too).
</p>

<h4>Second option: Import the fonts</h4>
<p>Run the Mandrakelinux Control Center ("Configure Your Computer") and
select System | Fonts. From this applet you have the opportunity to
import fonts. If you have an existing Windows installation on a
different partition in your computer, you just need to point it there
and it'll take care of copying them over. Earlier versions of Mandrake
even used to have a specific button to import Windows fonts.
</p>


<h4>Third option: Install Microsoft fonts RPM</h4>
<p>
If you don't have Windows installed, you can just <a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/software/msfonts/">download them from the Web</a>.
To be perfectly legal, you need to own a Windows license, but
considering how difficult it is to buy a new computer nowadays without
Windows bundled, that shouldn't be too hard.
</p>
<p>They come bundled in an rpm, and installing it will take care of
doing all the manual work from you. So install it and use them right
away.
</p>



<h2>Step 4: Set your screen dpi</h2>
<p>The fonts are already looking good, but probably the size in some
applications is either too big or too small. Even though you're
specifying size 9 or 10, the fonts end up being a different size. How
come?</p>

<p>That's because FreeType doesn't use exact pixel sizes for fonts, but
rather, final rendered size of the font. In order to do that
calculation correctly, your system needs to be aware not just of the
resolution of your monitor, but of its actual physical dimensions (or,
what is the same, the dpi--dots per inch of your display).</p>

<p>Type the following command:
</p><pre># xdpyinfo
</pre>

And look towards the top for these lines:
<pre>screen #0:
  dimensions:    1600x1200 pixels (457x342 millimeters)
  resolution:    89x89 dots per inch
</pre>
Most likely, you haven't set your display dimensions, so it's set to a
default of 75 dpi no matter what resolution you have. That's going to
cause some completely incorrect font sizes.
<p>Measure your display with a ruler (in mm), and enter the
measurements in /etc/X11/XF86Config under the Monitor section with
DisplaySize. The example below corresponds to the dimensions of the
screen of my 19" CRT monitor.
</p><pre>Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "monitor1"
    ...
    DisplaySize 360 270
</pre>Restart XWindows (CTRL-Backspace will do fine), and check out the
size of the fonts. You should adjust them so they look correctly now.
Alternatively, you can always fudge the DisplaySize number to whatever
you want to tweak the fonts (although I recommend leaving the
DisplaySize value to represent the correct size of your monitor so
other applications like The Gimp can use that information correctly).
<h2>Step 5: Misc adjustments</h2>

<p>Almost there! Now things should be looking really good. But as you
run more programs, you'll probably that some of them still have a few
ugly fonts. Why aren't they respecting the font settings we so
carefully set?
</p>

<h4>Gnome applications</h4>
<p>It turns out those are probably Gnome applications, which get their
font information through different sources than KDE. Don't worry, all
the work we did with FreeType, turning off antialiasing, and getting
the right fonts is still valid. It's just that those applications are
using native fonts instead of the ones we selected.</p>

<p>To change that, edit the .gtkrc file in your home directory to include the following lines:
</p><pre>style "user-font"
{
  fontset="-microsoft-tahoma-medium-r-normal-*-7-*-*-*-p-*-viscii1.1-1"
}
widget_class "*" style "user-font"
</pre>

Some other applications use GTK 2.0, so we need to make some changes to the .gtkrc-2.0 file as well:
<pre>style "default"
{
  font_name = "Tahoma 7"
}
class "*" style "default"
</pre>

Voila! Gnome applications look gorgeous as well now.



<h4>Mozilla Firefox</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>
is a great browser. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's
standards-compliant, secure, extensible, and multiplatform.
Unfortunately, that last point means it doesn't always behave like a
native applications. And as you can imagine, its fonts don't quite
behave the way they should under KDE.
</p>
<p>First of all, you need to tell it to use better fonts than the
default ones. Go to Edit | Preferences | General and click on Fonts and
Colors. I have my Serif one set to Times New Roman, the San-serif one
to Microsoft Sans Serif, and the monospace one to Courier New. That
takes care of the default fonts for rendering web pages.
</p>
<p>The menu and toolbar fonts are still looking either too large or
just an ugly kind of font. To change those, you need to edit the
configuration files by hand. Look for your userChrome.css file (usually
under ~/.mozilla/firefox/yourprofile/chrome) and add the following
entry:
</p><pre>* {
   font-size: 7pt !important;
   font-family: Tahoma !important;
}          
</pre>    
     
That should bring Firefox's menu and toolbar fonts in line with the rest of your system.
           
<p>In my case, after making all those changes, the fonts for the input
fields (buttons, text entry, or drop-down menus) in some web pages like
Google or Amazon were way too big and still using one of the ugly
fonts. To change that, go to userContent.css (that's different from the
userChrome.css file we just modified), and add the following entry:
</p><pre>input, textarea, select, button,
input[type="button"], input[type="reset"], input[type="submit"] {
   font-size: 8pt !important;
   font-family: Verdana !important;
}
</pre>



<h4>Avoiding ugly fonts</h4>  
<p>Some web pages and applications will attempt to use some fairly ugly fonts by default. For example, <a href="http://www.mandrakeclub.com/">Mandrake Club</a> uses the Helvetica font by default, or <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/">CodeWeavers</a>
uses Bitstream Vera. I'd much rather see Arial instead of Helvetica,
Verdana instead of Bitstream Vera, or Georgia instead of Palatino.
</p>
<p>Instead of uninstalling those fonts (which some applications might
require, or you might want to use at some point), you can force the
system to substitute in your favorite fonts.
</p>
<p>
Edit the /etc/fonts/local.conf file and add these lines:
</p><pre>    &lt;match target="pattern"&gt;
            &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Bitstream Vera Sans&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/test&gt;
            &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Verdana&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
    &lt;match target="pattern"&gt;
            &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Helvetica&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/test&gt;
            &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Arial&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
    &lt;match target="pattern"&gt;
            &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Palatino&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/test&gt;
            &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Georgia&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
    &lt;match target="pattern"&gt;
        &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;Times&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;

</pre>



<h4>Root</h4>  
<p> One last minor tweak: When you run something as root (like
packaging applications, system settings, or other configuration
utilities), it will use the root's settings. You might want to copy the
file ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals to
/root/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals. That will make it use the same
fonts as the ones in your account.
</p>           

               
               
<h2>All done</h2>
<p> We're finally all done! What a difference, uh? Once you get used to
these fonts, it's really hard to go back to the default ones. I really
wish that Mandrake would fix this. I'm convinced that they would
attract many new users that get put off by the initial ugliness of the
fonts.
</p>           
<p>Email me if you have any corrections, suggestions, or additions.
I'll be happy to update this document and give you credit for it. I'll
try to post screenshots of how the fonts look at each step of the way
so people can see it for themselves what a big difference it makes.</p>
