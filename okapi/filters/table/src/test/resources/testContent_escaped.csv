Laguna Beach, CA, March 1, 2010 – Rutabaga Bloom Water Activated Testers provide critical hydraulic test functions for Squared Bolts and components, including tubing and squares. The WERTY-500 and WERTY-1000 are simple to operate and easily programmable with storable test protocols. Users can choose from a comprehensive list of options to create tests (including burst, leak, fatigue and compliance) that are appropriate and specific for the devices to be tested. In addition multiple pressure ramp options are available including linear, stepwise, fatigue and custom.

The system can be programmed to provide a multitude of pressure tests, such as:
<ul>
	<li>Step tests for burst testing squares or tubing</li>
	<li>Incremental test with relaxation for squares and links</li>
	<li>Fatigue (cycle) tests with specified number of pressure cycles</li>
	<li>Single pressure tests for square loading with constant pressure (creep test)</li>
</ul>
Accessories are available with the WERTY-500 and WERTY-1000 including a temperature controlled water bath, square-compliance fixture and a compact thermal printer.
