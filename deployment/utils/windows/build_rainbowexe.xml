	This file build rainbow.exe only. It should be run only when something changes in the .exe configuration or
	for some reasons the .exe needs to be updated.
	The built .exe is placed in this directory. It should be copy to the proper location.
	This means the main rainbow build can be done a) without installing launch4j and b) on non-Windows platforms.
