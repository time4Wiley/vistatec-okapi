<p class="notice">If you are using an Okapi Tool after the M9 release, you should be using the wiki online help:<br>
<a target="_top" href="http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=CheckMate">http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=CheckMate</a></p>

<p>The main window is divided in two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The upper part shows the source and traget text of the item where the 
	issue currently selected is located.</li>
	<li>The lower part shows the list of issues detected. Which issues are 
	displayed depends on several options.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Table</h3>
<p>The table displays the issues found with the documents in the session. Use
<cite>Check All</cite> to re-process the documents if you fix or modify one.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Column 1 indicates if the issue is <b>enabled</b> (check mark set) or <b>
	disabled</b> (check mark not set). An issue that is enabled is 
	concidered valid (i.e. a real problem), while an issue that is disabled is, in the context where 
	it occurs, not a problem (i.e. a non-issue), a false 
	positive. Checkmate remembers the issues you have disabled, so it keeps them 
	disabled each time you re-process the documents.</li>
	<li>Column 2 indicates the potential severity of the warning: Reg: high, 
	Orange: medium, Yellow: low. This information is a mix of how confident the 
	tool is about the error and how dangerous this type of error is. For 
	example: missing a pattern like &quot;%s&quot; is both easy to detect and certainly 
	dangerous, so its severity can be rated &quot;high&quot;. On the other hand, a 
	translation missing parentheses is easy to detect, but may or may not 
	correspond to a translation problem, so its severity should be rated &quot;low&quot;.</li>
	<li>Column 3 (<cite>Text Unit</cite>) displays the ID of the text unit where 
	the issue occurs. If the text unit has a native name (e.g. an ID in a 
	propertis file) it is also displayed between parentheses.</li>
	<li>Column 4 (<cite>Seg</cite>) displays the ID of the segment where the 
	issue occurs, or nothing if the warning is for the whole text unit.</li>
	<li>Column 5 (<cite>Description</cite>) shows the warning message for the 
	issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sort -- You can sort the issues in the table by clicking on the header of each 
column. Note that the <cite>Text Unit</cite> and <cite>Seg</cite> columns are 
sorted by a combination of the document ID, the text unit ID and the segment ID. 
These IDs are alphanumeric, not numeric (e.g. the ID can be 
&quot;tu1&quot; not always &quot;1&quot;). When the IDs happend to be using only numbers, the sort 
may look strange as &quot;101&quot; comes after &quot;1001&quot; (where you may expect to see 101 to 
come before 1001).</p>
<h3>Context Menu</h3>
<p>You can right-click on an issue listed in the table to obtain a context menu. 
It offers the following commands:</p>
<p><cite>Open Document</cite> -- Select this command to open the document where 
the selected issue is located. This opens the file using whatever program is 
associated by the system with the type of the input document.</p>
<p><cite>Open Containing Folder</cite> -- Select this command to open the folder 
containing the document where the selected issue is located.</p>
<p><cite>Edit Configuration</cite> -- Select this command to edit the parameters for the 
verification.</p>
<p><cite>Check All</cite> -- Select this command to run the verification on all 
documents in the session.</p>
<p><cite>Check Current Document</cite> -- Select this command to run the 
verification only on the current document.</p>
<p><cite>Add Document</cite> -- Select this command to add an input document to 
the session.</p>
<p><cite>Copy Text Unit Extraction ID</cite> -- Select this command to copy to 
the Clipboard the extraction ID of the text unit for the current issue. This can 
be useful to locale quickly an entry in file translation formats like XLIFF.</p>
<p>In addition, depending on the issue currently selected you may have 
additional commands available:</p>
<p><cite>Copy Text Unit Resource ID/Name</cite> -- If the text unit of the 
current issue has a name associate (i.e. resname in XLIFF) select this command 
to copy it to the Clipboard. This name is listed between parentheses in the
<cite>Text Unit</cite> column.</p>
<p><cite>Allow &quot;&lt;code&gt;&quot; as a Missing Code</cite> -- If the issue indicates one 
or more codes missing in the target, the menu shows this command for each 
missing code. Select this command to add the given code to the list of codes 
that are allowed to be missing from the target segments. You can manage the 
complete list in the <cite><a href="parameterseditor.html#InlineCodesTab">Quality Check 
Configuration</a></cite> dialog.</p>
<p><cite>Allow &quot;&lt;code&gt;&quot; as an Extra Code</cite> -- If the issue indicates one or 
more extra codes in the target, the menu shows this command for each extra code. 
Select this command to add the given code to the list of codes that are allowed 
to be extra in the target segments. You can manage the complete list in the
<cite><a href="parameterseditor.html#InlineCodesTab">Quality Check Configuration</a></cite> 
dialog.</p>
<h3>Enabling/Disabling Issues</h3>
<p>Which issues are displayed in the table is driven by the two list-boxes below 
the table on the right-hand side:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first one selects the types of issue to display: Choose <cite>&lt;All 
	types of issues&gt;</cite> to display issues of any types.</li>
	<li>The second one selects where to display enabled and disabled issues. Usually you want to display only the issues that are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>To toggle the status of a given issue between enabled or disabled, simply 
check or uncheck its corresponding check mark. You can click on the check box, 
or select the issue and press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. You can select multiple 
issues at the same time by holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key pressed while moving 
the cursor up or down.</p>
<p>You can re-enabled all issues with the command <cite>Reset All Disabled 
Issues</cite> from the <cite>Issues</cite> menu.</p>
<h3>List of the Documents</h3>
<p>The list of the documents for which there is one or more issues is displayed 
above the table. The list is always set to the document of the issue currently 
selected.</p>
<p>You can select another document in the list to move to the first issue for 
that document in the issues currently displayed.</p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p><cite>Check All</cite> -- Click this button to run the verification on all 
documents in the session.</p>
<p><cite>Check Document</cite> - Click this button to run the verification only on 
the current document.</p>
<p><cite>Session</cite> -- Click this button to open the <cite>
<a href="sessionsettings.html">Session Settings</a></cite> 
dialog box, where you can add or removed the documents in the session, and edit 
other parameters.</p>
<p><cite>Configuration</cite> -- Click this button to open the <cite>
<a href="parameterseditor.html">Quality Check Configuration</a></cite> 
dialog box, where you can specify what kind of verifications to perform.</p>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>

<p>At the bottom of the main window, the status bar indicates:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the current issue selected</li>
	<li>how many issues are listed in the table</li>
	<li>how many issues there are in total (listed and hidden)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: &quot;<code>5 / 17 / T=23</code>&quot; indicates that you are on the fifth 
issue of the table, which lists 17 issues, and that there are 23 issues in 
total.</p>
