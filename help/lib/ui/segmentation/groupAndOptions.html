language maps.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><cite>Segment sub-flow items</cite> -- Set this option to set the SRX <code>
segmentsubflows</code> attribute to <code>yes</code>. This option is used by 
some tool to know if they should segment text runs embedded inside other text 
runs.</p>
<p><cite>Cascade language maps matching</cite> -- Set this option to enable 
language map matches to cascade.</p>
<p><cite>Include opening in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
opening in-line code located just before a break with the segment being 
closed. If this option is not set such in-line code should be placed in the next 
segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence one.&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt; ==&gt; [Sentence one.&lt;b&gt;][ Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt;]
OFF: Sentence one.&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt; ==&gt; [Sentence one.][&lt;b&gt; Sentence two.&lt;/b&gt;]</pre>
<p><cite>Include closing in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
closing in-line code located just before a break with the segment being 
closed. If this option is not set such in-line code should be placed in the next 
segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt;][ Sentence two.]
OFF: Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence &lt;b&gt;one.][&lt;/b&gt; Sentence two.]</pre>
<p><cite>Include isolated in-line codes</cite> -- Set this option to include any 
isolated code located just before a break with the segment being closed.

segment. For example, assuming a period follow by a space has a break after the 
period:</p>
<pre> ON: Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt;][ Sentence two.]
OFF: Sentence one.&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two. ==&gt; [Sentence one.][&lt;br/&gt; Sentence two.]</pre>
