<p class="notice">If you are using an Okapi Tool after the M9 release, you should be using the wiki online help:<br>

<p>This dialog box allows you to create, modify and execute pipelines. For more detailed information about what pipelines are, see the
<a href="../pipelines.html">Pipelines section</a>.</p>
<p>The top text field shows the name of the current pipeline. It is empty if the 
pipeline is not saved to a pipeline file. Note that the last pipeline used is 
always saved along with the current project file.</p>
<p>The left-hand list is a list of all the steps that make up the current 
pipeline. The steps are executed from top to botton, in the order shown in this 
list.</p>
<p>The right-hand panel shows the options associated with the step currently 
selected in the left-hand list. Some steps may not have any option, in that case 
the panel simply shows the message &quot;<code>This step has no parameters</code>&quot;.</p>
<p><cite>Add Step</cite> -- Click this button to add a new step at the end of the current 
pipeline. You can move the new step anywhere in the list using the <cite>Move Up</cite> 
and <cite>Move Down</cite> buttons. The Okapi distribution comes with a set of
<a href="../../../steps/index.html">pre-existing steps you can use right out of 
the box</a>, and you may have additional plugin steps as well.</p>
<p><cite>Remove Step</cite> -- Click this button to remove the selected step 
from the current pipeline.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the selected step upward 
(the step executed first is the one at the top of the list). In Rainbow the 
first step of a pipeline should always be a step that takes a raw document as 
input. the raw documents are provided from files listed in the <cite>
<a href="../main.html#InputLists">Input List 1</a></cite>.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the selected step 
downward (the step executed last is the one at the bottom of the list).</p>
<p><cite>Load</cite> -- Click this button to load an existing pipeline from a 
pipeline file.</p>
<p><cite>New</cite> -- Click this button to start a new pipeline.</p>
<p><cite>Save</cite> -- Click this button to save the current pipeline to a 
pipeline file. If the 
current pipeline has no name yet, you will be prompted to provide a file name 
and a location.</p>
<p><cite>Save As</cite> -- Click this button to save the current pipeline under 
a new file name or at a new location.</p>
<p><cite>Step Help</cite> -- Click this button to open the help file for the 
step currently selected. The text field after the button shows a short 
description of that step.</p>
