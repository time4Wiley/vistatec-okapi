<p class="notice">If you are using an Okapi Tool after the M9 release, you should be using the wiki online help:<br>
<a target="_top" href="http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=Rainbow">http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=Rainbow</a></p>

<p>This utility allows you to create a translation package for a given set of 
input documents.</p>
<h2>Input Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The list of the source documents to translate (Input list 1).</li>
	<li>The source language.</li>
	<li>The target language.</li>
	<li>The default input encoding.</li>
	<li>The output encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Package Format Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Type of package to create</cite> -- Select the type of package you want 
to create. Note that not all types of input document can be prepared using some 
type of package. For example, the type <cite>Original + RTF Layer</cite> cannot 
be applied to original files that or in some kind of binary formats.</p>
<p>There are several types of package available:</p>
<ul>
	<li><cite><a href="#genericXLIFF">Generic XLIFF</a></cite>: Simple package where all files to translate 
	are extracted to XLIFF. You can translate this package with any XLIFF 
	editor.</li>
	<li><cite><a href="#omegat">OmegaT</a></cite>: OmegaT project with all its files and 
	directory structure in place. You can translate this package with 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT</a>.</li>
	<li><cite><a href="#originalPlusRTF">Original + RTF Layer</a></cite>: Package where all the files 
	to translate are converted into an RTF file with Trados-compatible styles. 
	You can translate this package with Trados Translator&#39;s Workbench or any 
	compatible tool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Package Location Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Root of the output directory</cite> -- Enter the root of the directory 
where to generate the package. You can use the variable <code>${ProjDir}</code> 
to specify the directory of your project.</p>
<p><cite>Package name</cite> -- Enter the name of the package to generate.</p>
<p>The combination of both entries makes up the full path of the output 
directory.</p>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Compress the package into a ZIP file</cite> -- Select this option to 
create a ZIP file that includes the whole package.</p>
<h4>Segmentation</h4>
<p><cite>Pre-segment the extracted text with the following SRX rules</cite> -- 
Set this option to segment the content of each extracted text unit.</p>
<p><cite>SRX file for the source</cite> -- Enter the path or URL of the SRX 
document where to take the SRX rules for the source language. You can use the 
variable <code>${ProjDir}</code> 
to specify the directory of your project.</p>
<p><cite>SRX file for the target</cite> -- Enter the path or URL of the SRX 
document where to take the SRX rules for the target language. Note that when the 
same document for both languages (most of the cases), the document is read only 
once, saving processing time. You can use the variable <code>${ProjDir}</code> 
to specify the directory of your project.</p>
<h3>Pre-Translation Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Pre-translate the extracted text using the following TM</cite> -- Set 
this option to use a translation resource to leverage matches 
into the prepared document (if the package to generate allows to do so). Select the translation resource to use.</p>
<p><cite>Settings</cite> -- Click this button to enter the settings for the 
selected translation resource. Not all translation resource connectors require 
settings. the current settings are displayed under the translation resource 
selection.</p>
<p>Be aware that some translation resources can be slow to access (especially 
those accessed through Internet), and using them may cause the process to be <b>
extremely long</b> to complete.</p>
<p><cite>Penalize matches with a FileName attribute different from the document 
being processed</cite> -- Set this option to 
filter the TM matches based on the values of <code>FileName</code> attribute. When this option is set, only the matches that 
have, not only the source text but also the values for <code>FileName</code> that match are leveraged. When this option is not set, 
the leveraging is not filtered by the <code>FileName</code> attribute.</p>
<p><cite>Penalize matches with a GroupName attribute different from the group 
being processed</cite> -- Set this option to 
filter the TM matches based on the values of <code>GroupName</code> attribute. When this option is set, only the matches that 
have, not only the source text but also the values for <code>GroupName</code> that match are leveraged. When this option is not set, 
the leveraging is not filtered by the <code>GroupName</code> attribute.</p>
<p><cite>Leverage only matches greater or equal to</cite> -- Set the threshold 
under which matches should not be leveraged. the value must be between 0 
(leverage anything) and 100 (leverage only exact matches). Note that if there are 
several matches (regardless of their scores) only the first one is generated in 
the <a href="#tmxOutput">TMX output</a> and, if the selected package allows it, 
in the translation file.</p>
<h3>About SimpleTM</h3>
<p><b>SimpleTM is a provisional simple TM engine</b> that can match only exact matches, 
and use attributes. It also allows multiple translations of the same source 
text. When the attributes are not used, you may get several exact matches, if at 
least of of them has a different translation, the segment is matched at 99% 
only. Segments that have the exact same text but inline codes that have 
different content or are in different order are matched at 99%. Optionally an 
additional 1% penality can be taken out of the score if the inline codes of the 
source and/or of the target have different content or are in a different order as the ones of the 
source text queried. The only types of matches SimpleTM can generate are: 100%, 99%, 
98%, and 0%.</p>
<p>Using the attributes with a SimpleTM memory filters out any candidate that 
does not have matching values for the given attributes:</p>
<p>For example, given an segment to leverage that is:<br>
Text = &quot;Segment text.&quot;<br>
FileName = myFile.ext<br>
GroupName = myGroup</p>
<table border="1" id="table1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td>Candidates in the TM</td>
		<td>FileName Off<br>
		GroupName Off</td>
		<td>FileName On<br>
		GroupName Off</td>
		<td>FileName Off<br>
		GroupName On</td>
		<td>FileName On<br>
		GroupName On</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Text = &quot;Segment text&quot;<br>
		FileName = myFile.ext<br>
		groupName = myGroup</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Text = &quot;Segment text&quot;<br>
		FileName = someFile.ext<br>
		groupName = myGroup</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Text = &quot;Segment text&quot;<br>
		FileName = myFile.ext<br>
		groupName = someGroup</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Text = &quot;Segment text&quot;<br>
		FileName = someFile.ext<br>
		groupName = someGroup</td>
		<td>Match 100%</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
		<td>No Match</td>
	</tr>

<p>In the future, the SimpleTM engine will be replaced by more a powerful TM engine: 
the Pensieve TM.</p>
<h3>About the Pensieve TM</h3>
<p>The Pensieve TM engine is Okapi&#39;s own TM engine. It is still under 
development, but can be used already for production work.</p>
<h2><a name="processing"></a>Processing Details</h2>
<p>The output of this utility varies depending on which type of package is 
selected.</p>
<h3><a name="genericXLIFF"></a>Generic XLIFF Package</h3>
<p>This package is an output where all translatable documents are extracted into 
XLIFF. You can translate this package with any XLIFF editor. Example of 
open-source tools that are XLIFF-capable are (among others):
<a href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT</a>,
<a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/index">Virtaal</a>,
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools">Qt Linguist</a>, and
<a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize">Lokalize</a>. </p>
<p>All the files to translated are in the <code>work</code> sub-directory.</p>
<p>The <code>original</code> sub-directory contains all the original documents 
and the parameters with which they have been extracted. You want to keep this 
sub-directory: It is used to merge back the extracted files into their original 
formats.</p>
<p>At the root of the package you will find:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>manifest.xml</code> file. Do not modify, rename, or change 
	otherwise this file. It will be used to merge back the extracted files into 
	their original formats.</li>
	<li>Any <a href="#tmxOutput">TMX output</a> file that was generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>To merge back the translation of this package use the <cite>
<a href="../merging/index.html">Translation Package Post-Processing</a></cite> 
utility.</p>
<h3><a name="omegat"></a>OmegaT Package</h3>
<p>this package is an output where all translatable documents are extracted into 
XLIFF-compatible files and an OmegaT project is created, with all its files and 
directory structure in place. You can translate this package with
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the XLIFF documents generated in this package are intended to be 
used only with OmegaT.</p>
<p>All the files to translated are in the <code>source</code> sub-directory.</p>
<p>The <code>original</code> sub-directory contains all the original documents 
and the parameters with which they have been extracted. You want to keep this 
sub-directory: It is used to merge back the extracted files into their original 
formats.</p>
<p>At the root of the package you will find:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>manifest.xml</code> file. Do not modify, rename, or change 
	otherwise this file. It may be used to post-process the converted files into 
	their original formats.</li>
	<li>The <code>omegat.project</code> file. this is the file that contains all 
	the settings for the OmegaT project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>tm</code> sub-directory contains the <code><a href="#tmxOutput">
unapproved.tmx</a></code>, <code><a href="#tmxOutput">alternate.tmx</a></code> 
and <code><a href="#tmxOutput">leverage.tmx</a></code> 
files if they were generated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <code>omegat</code> sub-directory contains the <code>
project_save.tmx</code> file if it was generated. This TMX document contains all 
entries set as approved, and well as all 100% matches of the leverage, if one 
was done.</p>
<p>To merge back the translation of this package:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the <cite>Create Translated Documents</cite> command from the <cite>
	Project</cite> menu of OmegaT. This will generate translated XLIFF documents 
	in the <code>target</code> sub-directory.</li>
	<li>Then use the <cite><a href="../merging/index.html">Translation Package 
	Post-Processing</a></cite> utility.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="originalPlusRTF"></a>Original + RTF Layer Package</h3>
<p>This package is an output where all the translatable documents are converted 
into RTF files with Trados-compatible styles. 
	You can translate this package with Trados Translator&#39;s Workbench or any 
	compatible tool.</p>

<a href="../merging/index.html">Translation Package Post-Processing</a></cite> 
utility.</p>
<h3><a name="tmxOutput"></a>TMX Output</h3>
<p>In all packages you may have one or more TMX documents generated. they 
correspond to possible existing translations obtained from the input documents 
themselves (some input formats such as PO or XLIFF may have been pre-translated 
already).</p>
<p>The <code>approved.tmx</code> document contains all the translations that 
were found in the original document and had an <i>approved</i> target property set to &quot;<code>yes</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>unapproved.tmx</code> document contains all the translations that 
were found in the original document and had no <i>approved</i> target property or an <i>approved</i> 
target property set to something else than &quot;<code>yes</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>alternate.tmx</code> document contains all the alternative 
translation that were found along with the text units in the original document. For example the 
translation found in the <code>&lt;alt-trans&gt;</code> elements of XLIFF files.</p>
<p>The <code>leverage.tmx</code> document contains the matches that were 
found if the pre-translation option was set.</p>
<p>Note that if one of these TMX output does not contain any entry it is not 
generated. Note also that the composition of each TMX document may be different 
depending on the package you have selected. See the details on each package 
description above.</p>
