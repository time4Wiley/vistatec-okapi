text units there are in this target document. For example: <code>Source #3 / 
Targets: 2144</code> means that you are aligning the third text unit of the

<h4 dir="ltr">Options and Actions (#6 in the screen shot)</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Synchronize scrolling</cite> -- Set this option to make 
synchronize the source and target segments list. When this option is set, 
selecting a segment in either the source or the target list will move the 
selection to the corresponding segment in the other list (if there is a 
corresponding segment).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Display in-line codes with generic markers</cite> -- Set this 
option to shown the in-line code as generic numbered place-holders instead of 
their real content. For example if you have a segment &quot;<code>Page [PgNum]</code>&quot; 
and &quot;<code>[PgNum]</code>&quot; is an in-line code, with this option set it will be 
shown as &quot;<code>Page &lt;1/&gt;</code>&quot;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Try an auto-correction automatically</cite> -- Set this 
option to automatically try to auto-correct segmentation when starting to edit 
the current text unit. This is the equivalent of clicking the <cite>Try Auto-Fix</cite> 
button immediately after the dialog box opens with a segmented text where 
incorrect segmentation has been detected. You are likely to want this option set 
all the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Verify in-line codes for text unit with a single segment</cite> 
-- Set this option to run the in-line code checker even on text units that have 
a single segment. In such segments any in-line code differences between source 
and target is not due to incorrect segmentation since both text units are seen 
as a single segment. So the differences are likely to be normal and may not be 
worth verifying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Try Auto-Fix</cite> -- Click this button to try to 
automatically merge some segments that may be incorrectly split. The changes are 
based on the presence of anchor points in different segments. If the option
<cite>Try an auto-correction automatically</cite> is set you do not have to use 
this button as the auto-correction is run each time you make a modification.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>To review later</cite> -- Set this option to mark all the 
segments for the current text unit with a special attribute &quot;<code>TO-REVIEW</code>&quot; 
in the TMX output. This allows you to flag alignments to be checked for 
correctness (For example when a localization engineer performs the alignment and 
the result needs it to be reviewed by a linguist). This flag is not set by default on any 
text unit.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Edit Rules</cite> -- Click this button to open the
<a target="_top" href="../../../../lib/ui/segmentation/index.html">Segmentation Rules Editor</a> 
for the current set of rules used. Note that any change you make in the rules
<b>is not reflected</b> on the current alignment process. They will take effect 
next time after you are done with the current process.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Edit Segment</cite> -- Click this button to edit the content 
of the current target segment. You must preserve the in-line codes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Swaps the target segment currently selected 
with the one just above.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Swaps the target segment currently 
selected with the one just below.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Join Next</cite> -- Joins the target segment currently 
selected with the one just below, transforming both segments into a single new 
one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Split</cite> -- Enables the target segment edit field so you 
can select a location in the target segment currently selected where to split it 
into two new segments. The segment will be split at the location of the cursor. 
If you select part of the segment content, the selection will be left as a 
non-segmented text between the two new segments.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Accept</cite> -- Accepts the current alignment and moves to 
the next text unit to align. This command is disabled if there is an error 
detected in the current alignment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Skip</cite> -- Moves to the next text unit to align without 
saving the current one into the TMX output.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Context Menu</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If you right-click the source or the target segments lists you open 
the context menu:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Get Machine Translation of Source</cite> -- Select this 
command to get a machine translation of the source segment currently selected. 
The translation is just a guess, but may help you in identifying the 
corresponding target segment of the given source segment. Note that the current 
source-to-target language pair may not be available in the machine translation 
engine.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>Get Machine Translation of Target</cite> -- Select this 
command to get a machine translation of the target segment currently selected. 
The translation is just a guess, but may help you in identifying the 
corresponding source segment of the given target segment. Note that the current 
target-to-source language pair may not be available in the machine translation 
engine.</p>
