<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>A pipeline is a customizable set of steps that takes the input documents 
provided in the input lists of Rainbow and execute each step in sequential 
order.</p>
<p>A step is a small component that takes a specific input (e.g a raw 
document), perform a specific 
task (e.g. parse the document extract text units out of it) on it and send a specific output 
(e.g. filter events) to the next step in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Okapi distribution comes with a set of <a href="../../steps/index.html">
pre-existing steps you can use right out of the box</a>, and you may have 
additional plugin steps as well.</p>
<p>The steps communicate through their input and output. There are two main 
types of input and output:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Raw document, which is simply a file.</li>
	<li>Filter events, which are the content of a raw document broken down into 
	standardized parts that include text units, start and end group, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any step that takes a raw document as input can be placed at the front of the 
pipeline or after any step that outputs a raw document. Any setp that takes 
filter events as input needs to be placed after a step that outputs filter 
events.</p>
<p>The step <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> is the normal way to get a filter 
events output from a raw document input. And the step <b>Filter Events to Raw 
Document</b> provides a way to create a raw document from an input of filter 
events, in the format of the original raw document. So, to simply extract and 
merge an input file, without doing anything special to it, the pipeline would be 
made of:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>To perform any kind of action that modify the extracted content, you simply 
add the necessary step or steps between those two. For example, imgine that you 
would want to make sure the Japanese text of a file uses full-width characters 
and never half-width ones, you would use the <b>Full-Width Conversion</b> step that 
allows you to convert the extacted text from half-width characters to full-width 
characters. You would have the following pipeline:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Full-Width Conversion</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>Any number of steps could be added between the extraction and the merging, 
allowing you to perform several tasks in a single process.</p>
<h2><a name="BasicDocDriven"></a>Basic Raw Document-Base Pipeline</h2>
<p>Not all steps require filter events. Some steps take a raw document and output a raw document, for example when they perform tasks on the fille as a whole 
rather than its translatable text.</p>
<p>For example, the step <b>Encoding Conversion</b> reads a text file (without 
any filter) in a given encoding, and re-writes it in a different one. This step 
can be used in a one-step pipeline:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Encoding Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that a few steps, such as <b>Search And Replace</b>, can take either a raw document 
or filter events as input and output either as well, depending on the step&#39;s 
options.</p>
<h2><a name="Complex"></a>Complex Pipelines</h2>
<p>The real power of pipelines really comes to light when you chain multiple 
steps without having to re-extract the text, or perform different raw-document 
taks one after the other automatically. You can also change the type of 
input/output several times in a single pipeline. For example, you could convert 
the content of an input document to full-width Japanese characters, then make 
sure its encoding&nbsp; is Shift-JIS, and then make sure all line-breaks are 
Unix line-breaks.</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Full-Width Conversion</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Encoding Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Line-Break Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>You can even add more steps to this pipeline that would go back to act on 
filter events. For example, to do a last search and replace on a specific 
pattern only inside the extracted text:</p>
<ol>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Full-Width Conversion</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Encoding Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Line-Break Conversion</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
	<li>raw document ==&gt; <b>Raw Document to Filter Events</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Search And Replace</b> ==&gt; filter events</li>
	<li>filter events ==&gt; <b>Filter Events to Raw Document</b> ==&gt; raw document</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that some steps generate outputs that are not necessarily passed on to 
the pipeline. For example, the <b>Used Character Listing</b> step generates one 
output file that contains the list of all characters used in all the text unit 
content of all the input files. It takes filter events as input and passes on 
(un-modified) filter events as output.</p>
<h2><a name="FAQ"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: How do I specify what filter configuration to use with the <b>Raw Document to 
Filter Events</b> step?<br>
A: In the Rainbow <cite>Input List</cite> tabs, you associate one filter configuration per 
input file.</p>
<p>Q: How do I specify the name of the output file?<br>
A: In the Rainbow&#39;s <cite>Other Settings</cite> tab, you can define the names and locations of all 
the input files based on their input file paths.</p>
<p>Q: How many steps can I chain together?<br>
A: There is no specific limit to the number of steps in a pipeline, only the 
available memory will limit what you can do (and pipeline definitions do not take up a lof 
of memory).</p>
<p>Q: What kind of file formats are supported?<br>
A: It depends. Filter events are generated only for files associated with 
filters, so to use a step that takes filter events, you must have a filter that 
support the given input file format. Some other steps act directly on the raw 
documents, often the only requirements for those is that they need to be 
text-based files.</p>
