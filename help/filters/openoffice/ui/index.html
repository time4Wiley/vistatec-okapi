<p class="notice">If you are using an Okapi Tool after the M9 release, you should be using the wiki online help:<br>

<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The OpenOffice Filter is an Okapi component that implements the <code>IFilter</code> interface for 
OpenOffice.org documents: ODT (text), ODS (spreadsheet), ODP (slides), and ODG 
(graphics). The filter is implemented in the class <code>
net.sf.okapi.filters.openoffice.OpenOfficeFilter</code> of the Okapi library.</p>
<p>This first filter is actually a wrapper that internally calls a second 
filter: The ODF Filter is an Okapi component that implements the <code>IFilter</code> 
interface for raw OpenDocument XML files. That filter is implement in the class <code>
net.sf.okapi.filters.openoffice.ODFFilter</code> of the Okapi library.</p>
<p>Having access to the two filters allows you to process OpenOffice.org documents, or directly raw ODF 
documents if needed.</p>

<h2><a name="processing"></a>Processing Details</h2>
<h3>Encodings</h3>
<p>The input encoding is automatically detected.</p>
<p>Any user-specified encoding is ignored by these filters. they always use 
UTF-8.</p>
<h3>Line-Breaks</h3>
<p>The type of line-breaks of the output is always set to a simple linefeed 
(LF).</p>
<h3>Sub-Documents</h3>
<p>An OpenOffice documents is a ZIP file with several documents inside. The main 
one (<code>content.xml</code>) contains the body of the data. But other files 
may also contain translatable text: <code>meta.xml</code> and <code>style.xml</code>.</p>
<p>All the different embedded files are treated as sub-documents by the filter. 
This means that, for example, when represented in XLIFF, a single ODT extracted 
to a single XLIFF document is made up three XLIFF <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> elements: 
One for <code>content.xml</code>, one for <code>style.xml</code>, and one for
<code>meta.xml</code>. Note that very often, only <code>content.xml</code> will 
have extracted text.</p>
<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Extract notes</cite> -- Set this option to extract the content of <code>
&lt;office:annotation&gt;</code> elements (notes) as translatable text. If this option 
is not set, notes are not extracted.</p>
<p><cite>Extract references</cite> -- Set this option to extract the content of
<code>&lt;text:bookmark-ref&gt;</code> elements. the content of these element is only 
a copy of the content of the referent. It is updated automatically within 
OpenOffice, so any translation done for these content will be automatically 
overwritten as soon as the document is updated. However, in some cases it may be 
useful to be able to have the referenced text as part of the segment where it is 
inserted.</p>
<h2><a name="knownIssues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<p>This filter has several know issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some deleted text may get extracted. Make sure you have accepted or 
	rejected the revisions changes before processing the input document, as 
	currently some text marked as deleted is still extracted.</li>
	<li>The options to extract or not the notes and the references is not 
	working yet. They wll be extracted regardless of the option settings.</li>
	<li>Sequential tabs may get reduced to a single tab during an extraction and 
	merge round trip: The elements for spaces and tabs are supported in output 
	but still incorrectly handled on input.</li>
</ul>
