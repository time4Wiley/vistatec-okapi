<p class="notice">If you are using an Okapi Tool after the M9 release, you should be using the wiki online help:<br>

<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Regex Filter is an Okapi component that implements the <code>IFilter</code> 
interface for any type of text-based formats where the 
text can be captured using regular expressions. The filter is implemented in the class <code>
net.sf.okapi.filters.regex.RegexFilter</code> of the Okapi library.</p>
<p>The filter can work with any text-based document. You define rules with 
regular expressions that indicate what part of the document to process. Each 
rule is associated with an action telling the filter what to do with the parts 
corresponding to its regular expression. Capturing groups in the regular 
expression allow you have the action do different things with sections of the 
matched text.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the following input document:</p>
<pre>[ID1]=Text for ID1
[ID2]:Text for ID2</pre>
<p>...and a rule with the following regular expression:</p>
<pre>^\[(.*?)](=|:)(.*?)$</pre>
<p>...and that rule is set to the action <cite>Extract the content</cite> and 
has the capturing group 3 assigned to the source group and the capturing group 1 
assigned to the identifier group.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each line in the input document will match the rule.</li>
	<li>A new text unit will be created for each match, with its name set to the 
	content of the capturing group 1, and its source text set to the content of 
	the capturing group 3.</li>
</ul>
<pre>[<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ID1</span>]=<span style="background-color: #00FF00">Text for ID1</span>
[<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ID2</span>]:<span style="background-color: #00FF00">Text for ID2</span>

^\[<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(.*?)</span>](=|:)<span style="background-color: #00FF00">(.*?)</span>$</pre>
<p>And if you were to represent the parsed information in XLIFF, it would look 
something like this:</p>
<pre>...
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;1&quot; resname=&quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ID1</span>&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;<span style="background-color: #00FF00">Text for ID1</span>&lt;/source&gt;
 &lt;/trans-unit&gt;
 &lt;trans-unit id=&quot;2&quot; resname=&quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ID2</span>&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;<span style="background-color: #00FF00">Text for ID2</span>&lt;/source&gt;
 &lt;/trans-unit&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
...</pre>
<h2><a name="processing"></a>Processing Details</h2>
<h3>Input Encoding</h3>
<p>The filter decides which encoding to use for the input document using the 
following logic:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the file has a Unicode Byte-Order-Mark:<ul>
		<li>Then, the corresponding encoding (e.g. UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) is used.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the input encoding used is the default encoding that was specified when 
	opening the document.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Encoding</h3>
<p>The filter does not recognize any encoding declarations in the document, and 
therefore cannot update them.</p>
<p>If the output encoding is UTF-8:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the input encoding was also UTF-8, a Byte-Order-Mark is used for the 
	output document only if one was detected in the input document.</li>
	<li>If the input encoding was not UTF-8, no Byte-Order-Mark is used in the 
	output document.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Line-Breaks</h3>
<p>The type of line-breaks of the output is the same as the one of the original 
input.</p>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>Here is how an input document is parsed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The filter sets the current search position at the top of the document.</li>
	<li>It searches for the first possible rule that has a match from a current 
	position.</li>
	<li>It takes the match and applies whatever action is associated with the 
	rule.</li>
	<li>It moves the current search position at the end of the match.</li>
	<li>The steps 2, 3, and 4 are repeated until no more matches are found or 
	the search position reaches the end of the document.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="actions"></a>Actions</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Each rule is associated with one of several possible actions. 
Depending on the action, you can associate different parts of the text that 
matches the rule with a specific role. This is done with the capturing groups. 
The source group, the target group, the identifier group and the note group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A capturing group is a part of the regular expression between 
parentheses. The capturing group 0 is the whole match, then other capturing 
groups are numbered by counting their opening parentheses from left to right. 
For example, in the expression <code>(A)(B(C))</code> there are three groups:</p>
<ol dir="ltr">
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><code>(A)</code></p></li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><code>(B(C))</code></p></li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><code>(C)</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The following table summarizes what each action does, and what the 
different groups it may use:</p>

<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Rules Tab</h3>
<p><cite>Add</cite> -- Click this button to add a new rule to the list. This 
opens the <cite><a href="editrule.html">Edit Rule</a></cite> dialog box with the new rule.</p>
<p><cite>Rename</cite> -- Click this button to rename the rule currently 
selected. Note that two rules can have the same name, but this is obviously not 
recommended.</p>
<p><cite>Remove</cite> -- Click this button to delete the rule currently 
selected from the list. No confirmation is asked.</p>
<p><cite>Edit</cite> -- Click this button to edit the rule currently selected. 
This opens the <cite><a href="editrule.html">Edit Rule</a></cite> dialog box.</p>
<p><cite>Move Up</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently selected 
up in the list. Rules are evaluated in the order of the list.</p>
<p><cite>Move Down</cite> -- Click this button to move the rule currently 
selected down in the list. Rules are evaluated in the order of the list.</p>
<h4>Rule properties</h4>
<p><cite>Preserve white spaces</cite> -- Set this option to preserve all white 
spaces of the extracted text. If this option is not set the extracted content is 
unwrapped: That is any sequence of consecutive white spaces is replaced by a 
single space character, and any white space character at the start or the end of 
the content is trimmed out. White spaces here are: spaces, tabs, carriage 
returns, and line-feeds.</p>
<p><cite>Has inline codes</cite> -- Set this option to enable the conversion of 
some part of the extracted text into inline codes.</p>
<p><cite>Edit Inline Codes Patterns</cite> -- Click this button to open the 
<cite>Inline Codes Patterns</cite> dialog box where you can define rules for converting parts 
of text into inline codes.</p>
<p><cite>Auto-close previous section when a new one starts</cite> -- Set this 
option to automatically close any opened section when a new one is starting. 
Section are defined with the <a href="#startSection"><cite>Start a section</cite> 
action</a>. This 
option allows you to define only start of sections. If this option is not set, 
each start of section must correspond to an end of section.</p>
<h4>Regular expressions options</h4>
<p>This set of options are used for all rules defined in the list. If you need 
to overwrite an option for a given rule, use the <code>(?idmsux-idmsux)</code> 
construct in the pattern for that rule.</p>
<p><cite>Dot also matches line-feed</cite> -- Set this option to enable the dot 
operator to match line-feeds.</p>
<p><cite>Multi-line</cite> -- Set this option so the expressions <code>^</code> 
and <code>$</code> match just after or just before, respectively, a line 
terminator or the end of the input sequence. If this option is not set these 
expressions only match at the beginning and the end of the entire input 
sequence.</p>
<p><cite>Ignore case differences</cite> -- Set this option to ignore differences 
between letter cases. If this option is set &quot;abc&quot; is seen as identical as &quot;Abc&quot;. 
If this option is not set, both strings are seen as different.</p>
<h3>Options Tab</h3>
<h4>Localization directives</h4>
<p><cite>Use localization directives when they are present</cite> -- Set this 
option to enable the filter to recognize localization directives. If this option 
is not set, any localization directive in the input file will be ignored.</p>
<p><cite>Extract items outside the scope of localization directives</cite> -- 
Set this option to extract any translatable item that is not within the scope of 
a localization directive. Selecting to extract or not outside localization 
directives allows you to mark up fewer parts of the source document. This option 
is enabled only when the <cite>Use localization directives when they are present</cite> 
option is set.</p>
<h4><a name="OptionsStrings"></a>Strings</h4>
<p><cite>Extract strings outside the rules</cite> -- Set this option to extract 
all strings that are outside the scope of all the defined rules. NOT IMPLEMENTED 
YET.</p>
<p><cite>Beginning of string</cite> -- Enter the character specifying the start 
of a string. Entering several characters defines several ways to start a string.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><cite>End of string</cite> -- Enter the character specifying the 
end of a string. If you have defined several beginning characters, you must 
defined an equal number of end characters, and the position of each end 
character must correspond to the position of its corresponding beginning 
character.</p>
<h4>Content type</h4>
<p><cite>MIME type of the document</cite> -- Enter the MIME type value to use 
when extracting content with this parameters. The value is used to identify the 
type of document. It may also change the way the text is written back into the 
original format. Most of the time <code>text/plain</code> should be fine.</p>
